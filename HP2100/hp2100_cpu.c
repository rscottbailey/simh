   Hewlett-Packard sold the HP 21xx/1000 family of real-time computers from 1966
   through 2000.  There are three major divisions within this family: the 21xx
   core-memory machines, the 1000 (originally 21MX) M/E/F-Series semiconductor-
   memory machines, and the 1000 L/A-Series machines.  All machines are 16-bit
   accumulator-oriented CISC machines running the same base instruction set.  A
   wide range of operating systems run on these machines, from a simple 4K word
   paper-tape-based monitor to a megaword multi-user, multiprogramming disc-
   based system and a multi-user time-shared BASIC system.

   This implementation is a simulator for the 2114, 2115, 2116, 2100, and 1000
   M/E/F-Series machines.  A large variety of CPU options, device interface
   cards, and peripherals are provided.  High-speed I/O transfers are performed
   by Direct Memory Access and Dual-Channel Port Controller options.  This
   simulator does not model the 1000 L/A-Series machines.

   All of the machines support a 15-bit logical address space, addressing a
   maximum of 32K words, divided into 1K-word pages.  Memory-referencing
   instructions in the base set can directly address the 1024 words of the base
   page (page 0) or the 1024 words of the current page (the page containing the
   instruction).  The instructions in the extended set directly address the
   32768 words in the full logical address space.  The A and B accumulators may
   be addressed as logical memory addresses 0 and 1, respectively.

   Peripheral devices are connected to the CPU by interface cards installed in
   the I/O card cages present in the CPU and optional I/O extender chassis.
   Each slot in the card cage is assigned an address, called a select code, that
   may be referenced by I/O instructions in the base set.  Select codes range
   from 0 to 77 octal, with the first eight select codes reserved for the
   system, providing connections for 56 possible interfaces.

   The 211x machines use a hardwired processor providing 70 basic instructions
   and up to 32K of core memory.  The base instruction set is divided into the
   Memory Reference Group, the Shift-Rotate Group, the Alter-Skip Group, and the
   I/O Group.  SRG instruction words may contain from one to four suboperation
   codes that are executed from left-to-right, and ASG instruction words may
   contain from one to eight suboperations.  An optional Extended Arithmetic
   Unit may be added to the 2115 and 2116 that provides hardware multiply and
   divide, double-load and -store, and double-word shift and rotate
   instructions.

   The 2100 machine uses a microprogrammed processor that provides the 80
   instructions of the base set and the EAU as standard equipment.  Optional
   floating-point microcode adds six two-word (single-precision) instructions.
   User microprogramming is also supported.  When used as part of an HP 2000
   Time-Shared BASIC system, the CPU designated as the I/O processor may be
   equipped with microcode implementing 18 additional OS accelerator
   instructions.

   The 1000 M/E-Series machines also use microprogrammed processors and extend
   the 2100 instruction set with two new index registers, X and Y, and a new
   Extended Instruction Group consisting of 32 index-register instructions and
   10 word-and-byte-manipulation instructions.  The six 2100 floating-point
   instructions are also standard.  The 1000 F-Series adds a hardware
   floating-point processor with 18 new triple- and quad-word instructions.  A
   number of optional microcode extensions are available with the M/E/F-Series.

   1000 CPUs offer the optional Dynamic Mapping System, which provides memory
   mapping on a page-by-page basis.  The 5-bit page number of a logical memory
   address selects one of 32 ten-bit map registers containing physical page
   numbers.  The ten-bit page number combined with the ten-bit page offset
   yields a 20-bit physical address capable of accessing a location in a
   one-megaword memory.  DMS provides separate maps for system and user
   programs, as well as for the two DCPC channels, and includes microcode that
   implements the 38 Dynamic Mapping Instructions used to manipulate the mapping
   system.

   Optional memory protection is accomplished by dividing the logical address
   space into protected and unprotected parts.  When protection is enabled, any
   attempt to write or jump below the fence separating the two parts is
   inhibited, and an interrupt to the operating system occurs, which aborts the
   offending user program.  If the DMS option is enabled as well, protection is
   enhanced by specifying read and write permissions on a page-by-page basis.

   A note on terminology: the 1000 series of computers was originally called the
   21MX at introduction.  The 21MX (occasionally, 21MXM) corresponds to the 1000
   M-Series, and the 21MXE (occasionally, 21XE) corresponds to the 1000
   E-Series.  The model numbers were changed before the introduction of the 1000
   F-Series, although some internal HP documentation refers to this machine as
   the 21MXF.

   The terms MEM (Memory Expansion Module), MEU (Memory Expansion Unit), DMI
   (Dynamic Mapping Instructions), and DMS (Dynamic Mapping System) are used
   somewhat interchangeably to refer to the logical-to-physical memory address
   translation option provided on the 1000-Series.  DMS consists of the MEM card
   (12731A) and the DMI firmware (13307A).  However, MEM and MEU have been used
   interchangeably to refer to the mapping card, as have DMI and DMS to refer to
   the firmware instructions.


   These CPU hardware registers are present in all machines:

     ----  -----  ----------------------------------------------
      A     16    Accumulator (addressable as memory location 0)
      B     16    Accumulator (addressable as memory location 1)
      P     15    Program counter
      S     16    Switch and display register
      M     15    Memory address register

      E      1    Extend flag (arithmetic carry out)
      O      1    Overflow flag (arithmetic overflow)

   In addition, there are two internal registers that are not visible to the
   programmer but are used by the hardware:

     Name  Width  Description
     ----  -----  ----------------------------------------------
      IR    16    Instruction register
     CIR     6    Central interrupt register

   The Instruction Register holds the current instruction, while the Central
   Interrupt Register holds the select code identifying an interrupting device.

   The 1000 Series adds these CPU hardware registers:

     Name  Width  Description
     ----  -----  ----------------------------------------------
      X     16    index register
      Y     16    index register

   The data types supported by the base instruction set are:

     - 8-bit unsigned byte
     - 16-bit unsigned integer
     - 16-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit two's-complement floating point

   Multi-word values are stored in memory with the most-significant words in the
   lowest addresses.  Bytes are stored in memory with the most-significant byte
   in the upper half of the 16-bit word and the least-significant byte in the
   lower half.

   The instruction set is fairly irregular -- a legacy of its original
   implementation in hardware in the 2116 and the accretion of microprogrammed
   instructions in the 2100 and 1000 CPUs.  Initially, there were five base-set
   instruction groups:

     1. Memory-Reference Group (MRG)
     2. Shift-Rotate Group (SRG)
     3. Alter-Skip Group (ASG)
     4. I/O Group (IOG)
     5. Macroinstruction Group (MAC)

   All of the instructions added after the 2116 are in the Macroinstruction
   Group.

   The 2116 offers two hardware options that extended the instruction set.  The
   first is the 12579A Extended Arithmetic Unit.  The second is the 2152A
   Floating Point Processor, which is interfaced through, and therefore
   requires, the EAU.  The EAU adds 10 instructions including integer multiply
   and divide and double-word loads, stores, shifts, and rotates.  The FPP adds
   30 floating-point arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential
   instructions.  The 2116 EAU is compatible with the 2100 and 1000 EAU
   implementations and is provided by the simulator.  The 2116 FPP is unique
   to that machine and is not simulated.

   The base set groups are decoded from bits 15-12 and 10, as follows:

     15  14-12  10  Group  Address Ranges
     --  -----  --  -----  -------------------------------
      x   nnn    x   MRG   010000-077777 and 110000-177777
      0   000    0   SRG   000000-001777 and 004000-005777
      0   000    1   ASG   002000-003777 and 006000-007777
      1   000    1   IOG   102000-103777 and 106000-107777
      1   000    0   MAC   100000-101777 and 104000-105777

   Where:

     x = don't care
     n = any combination other than all zeros

   The MAC group is subdivided into the Extended Arithmetic Group (EAG) and the
   User Instruction Group (UIG), based on bits 11, 9, and 8, as follows:

     11   9   8  Group  Address Range
     --  --  --  -----  -------------
      0   0   0  EAG    100000-100377
      0   0   1  EAG    100400-100777
      0   1   0  EAG    101000-101377
      0   1   1  UIG-1  101400-101777
      1   0   0  EAG    104000-104377
      1   0   1  EAG    104400-104777
      1   1   0  UIG-0  105000-105377
      1   1   1  UIG-1  105400-105777

   All of the 2116 FPP instructions are in the UIG sets: 3 use 10144x opcodes
   and the rest use 1050xx and 1054xx opcodes.  The 2100 decodes only UIG-0
   instructions, whereas the 1000s use both UIG sets.  In particular, the
   105740-105777 range is used by the 1000 Extended Instruction Group (EIG),
   which is part of the 1000-Series base set.

   The 21xx and 1000 M/E/F-Series machines do not trap unimplemented
   instructions.  In general, unimplemented EAG instructions cause erroneous
   execution, and unimplemented UIG instructions execute as NOP.  However, there
   are machine-to-machine variations, and some unimplemented instructions
   execute as other, defined instructions.

   The Memory-Reference Group instructions are encoded as follows:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

   Where:

     R = A/B register (0/1)

   Bits 8-4 encode the microcode module containing the instructions, and bits
   3-0 encode the specific instructions.  See the individual UIG instruction
   simulator source files for the specific encodings used.


   I/O device interfaces and their connected devices are simulated by
   substituting software states for I/O backplane signals.  The set of signals
   generated by I/O instructions and DMA cycles is dispatched to the target
   interface simulator for action, and the set of signals asserted or denied in
   response is returned from the call.  Backplane signals are processed
   sequentially.  For example, the "STC sc,C" instruction generates the "set
   control" and the "clear flag" signals that are processed in that order.

   The HP 21xx/1000 interrupt structure is based on the PRH, PRL, IEN, IRQ, and
   IAK signals.  PRH indicates that no higher-priority device is interrupting.
   PRL indicates to lower-priority devices that a given device is not
   interrupting.  IEN asserts when the interrupt system is enabled.  IRQ
   indicates that a given device is requesting an interrupt.  IAK indicates that
   the given device's interrupt request is being acknowledged.

   Typical I/O interfaces have a flag buffer, a flag, and a control flip-flop.
   If an interface's flag buffer, flag, and control flip-flops are all set, the
   interrupt system is enabled, and the interface has the highest priority on
   the interrupt chain, it requests an interrupt by asserting the IRQ signal.
   When the interrupt is acknowledged with the IAK signal, the flag buffer is
   cleared, preventing further interrupt requests from that interface.  The
   combination of flag set and control set blocks interrupts from lower priority
   devices.

   Service requests are used to trigger the DMA service logic.  Setting the
   interface flag flip-flop typically asserts SRQ, although SRQ may be
   calculated independently.

   Most of the I/O signals are generated by execution of IOG instructions or DMA
   cycles; the target interface simulator is called explicitly to respond to the
   signal assertions.  However, two hardware signals (ENF and SIR) are periodic,
   and a direct simulation would call each interface simulator with these
   signals after each machine instruction.  Instead, the interface simulator is
   called only when these signals would have an effect on the state of the
   interface.  Also, two signals (IEN and PRH) are combinatorial, in that
   changing either potentially affects all interfaces in the system.  These are
   handled efficiently by saving the states of each interface in bit vectors, as
   described below.

   PRH and PRL form a hardware priority chain that extends from interface to
   interface on the backplane.  For an interface to generate an interrupt, PRH
   must be asserted by the next-higher-priority interface.  When an interface
   generates an interrupt, it denies PRL to the next-lower-priority interface.
   When an interface is not interrupting, it passes PRH to PRL unaltered.  This
   means that a given interface can interrupt only if all higher-priority
   devices are receiving PRH asserted and are asserting PRL.  It also means that
   clearing the interrupt on a given interface, i.e., reasserting PRL, may
   affect all lower-priority interfaces.

   As an example, assume that the interface at select code 10 ("SC 10") has its
   flag buffer, flag, and control flip-flops set, that IEN and PRH are asserted,
   and that no other interfaces have their flag flip-flops set.  SC 10 will
   assert IRQ and deny PRL.  SC 11 sees its PRH low (because PRL 10 is connected
   to PRH 11) and so denies PRL, and this action ripples through all of the
   lower-priority interfaces.

   Then, while the interrupt for SC 10 is being serviced, the interface at
   select code 17 sets its flag buffer, flag, and control flip-flops.  SC 17 is
   inhibited from interrupting by PRH denied.

   When the interrupt service routine clears the interrupt by clearing the flag
   buffer and flag flip-flops, SC 10 reasserts PRL to SC 11, and that signal
   ripples through the interfaces at select codes 12-16, arriving at SC 17 as
   PRH assertion.  With PRH asserted, SC 17 generates an interrupt and denies
   PRL to SC 20 and above.

   A direct simulation of this hardware behavior would require calling all
   lower-priority interface simulators in ascending select code (and therefore
   priority) order with the PRH signal and checking for an asserted IRQ signal
   or a denied PRL signal.  This is inefficient.

   To avoid making a potentially long sequence of calls, each interface
   simulator returns a "conditional IRQ" signal and a "conditional PRL" signal
   in addition to the standard IRQ and PRL signals.  The conditional signals
   are those that would result if the higher-priority interface is asserting
   PRH and the interrupt system is on.  So, for instance, an interface simulator
   with its flag buffer, flag, and control flip-flops set will assert its
   conditional IRQ signal and deny its conditional PRL signal.  If PRH and IEN
   are asserted, then its "real" IRQ and PRL signals are also asserted and
   denied respectively.

   For fast assertion checking, the conditional IRQ and PRL signal states are
   kept in bit vectors, which are updated after each interface simulator call.
   Each vector is represented as a two-element array of 32-bit unsigned
   integers, forming a 64-bit vector in which bits 0-31 of the first element
   correspond to select codes 00-37 octal, and bits 0-31 of the second element
   correspond to select codes 40-77 octal.  The "interrupt_request_set" array
   holds conditional IRQ states, and the "priority_holdoff_set" array holds the
   complement of the conditional PRL states (the complement is used to simplify
   the priority calculation).  These vectors permit rapid determination of an
   interrupting interface when a higher-priority interface reasserts PRL or when
   the interrupt system is reenabled.


   The simulator provides three stop conditions related to instruction execution
   that may be enabled with a SET CPU STOP=<stop> command:

     <stop>  Action
     ------  ------------------------------------------
     UNIMPL  stop on an unimplemented instruction
     UNDEF   stop on an undefined instruction
     UNSC    stop on an access to an unused select code
     IOERR   stop on an unreported I/O error

   If an enabled stop condition is detected, execution ceases with the
   instruction pending, and control returns to the SCP prompt.  When simulation
   stops, execution may be resumed in two ways.  If the cause of the stop has
   not been remedied and the stop has not been disabled, resuming execution with
   CONTINUE, STEP, GO, or RUN will cause the stop to occur again.  Alternately,
   specifying the "-B" switch with any of the preceding commands will resume
   execution while bypassing the stop for the current instruction.

   The UNIMPL option stops the simulator if execution is attempted of an
   instruction provided by a firmware option that is not currently installed
   (e.g., a DAD instruction when the double-integer firmware is not installed)
   or of an opcode provided by an installed option but not assigned to an
   instruction (e.g., opcode 105335 from the double-integer firmware).
   Bypassing the stop will execute the instruction as a NOP (no-operation).

   The UNDEF option stops the simulator if execution is attempted of an
   instruction containing a decoded reserved bit pattern other than that defined
   in the Operating and Reference manual for the CPU.  For example, opcodes
   101700 and 105700 are not listed as DMS instructions, but they execute as
   XMM instructions, rather than as NOP.  The intent of this stop is to catch
   instructions containing reserved fields with values that change the meaning
   of those instructions.  Bypassing the stop will decode and execute the
   instruction in the same manner as the selected CPU.

   The UNSC option stops the simulator if an I/O instruction addresses a select
   code that is not assigned to an enabled device (equivalent to an empty
   hardware I/O backplane slot).  Bypassing the stop will read the floating
   S-bus or I/O-bus for LIA/B and MIA/B instructions or do nothing for all other
   instructions.

   The IOERR option stops the simulator if an I/O error condition exists for a
   device that does not report this status to the CPU.  For example, the paper
   tape reader device (PTR) does not report "no tape loaded" status, and the
   processor interconnect device (IPL) does not report "cable disconnected."  In
   both cases, I/O to the device will simply hang with no indication of the
   problem.  Enabling the IOERR option will stop the simulator with an error
   indication for these devices.

   In addition, a simulation stop will occur if an indirect addressing chain
   exceeds the maximum length specified by a SET CPU INDIR=<limit> command.
   Memory addresses may be indirect to indicate that the values point to the
   target addresses rather than contain the target addresses.  The target of an
   indirect address may itself be indirect, and the CPU follows this chain of
   addresses until it finds a direct address.  Indirect addressing is typically
   only one or two levels deep, but if the chain loops back on itself (e.g., if
   an indirect address points at itself), then instruction execution will hang.

   The limit may be set to any number of levels up to 32,768.  This is the
   absolute maximum number of levels that can be created without an infinite
   loop -- each location in memory points to the next one except for the last,
   which contains the target value.  In practice, anything over a few levels
   likely represents a programming error.  The default setting is 16 levels.


   The CPU simulator provides extensive tracing capabilities that may be enabled
   with the SET DEBUG <filename> and SET CPU DEBUG=<trace> commands.  The trace
   options that may be specified are:

   The INSTR option traces instruction executions and interrupts.  Each
   instruction is printed in symbolic form before it is executed.

   The DATA option traces reads from and writes to memory.  Each access is
   classified by its usage type as "data" (using the current or alternate map
   with access protection) or "unprotected" (using a specified map without
   protection).

   The FETCH option traces instruction fetches from memory.  Reads of the
   additional words in a multiword instruction, such as the target address of a
   DLD (double load) instruction, are also classified as fetches.

   The REG option traces register values.  Two sets of registers are printed.
   After executing each instruction, the working registers (A, B, E, O, S, and,
   for 1000 CPUs, X and Y) and the state of the interrupt system (on or off) are
   printed.  After executing an instruction that may alter the Memory Protect or
   Memory Expansion Module state, the MP fence and violation registers, the MEM
   status and violation registers, and the current protection state are printed.

   The OPND option traces operand values.  Some instructions that take memory
   and register operands that are difficult to decode from DATA or REG traces
   present the operand values in a higher-level format.  The operand data and
   value presented are specific to the instruction; see the instruction executor
   comments for details.

   The EXEC option traces the execution of instructions that match
   user-specified criteria.  When a match occurs, all CPU trace options are
   turned on for the duration of the execution of the matched instruction.  The
   prior trace settings are restored when a match fails.  This option allows
   detailed tracing of specified instructions while minimizing the log file size
   compared to a full instruction trace.

   The various trace formats are interpreted as follows:

   Implementation notes:

    1. The simulator is fast enough, compared to the run-time of the longest
       instructions, for interruptibility not to matter.  However, the HP
       diagnostics explicitly test interruptibility in the EIS and DMS
       instructions and in long indirect address chains.  Accordingly, the
       simulator does "just enough" to pass these tests.  In particular, if an
       interrupt is pending but deferred at the beginning of an interruptible
       instruction, the interrupt is taken at the appropriate point; but there
       is no testing for new interrupts during execution (that is, the event
       timer is not called).

    2. The Power Fail option is not currently implemented.

    3. Idling with 4.x simulator framework versions after June 14, 2018 (git
       commit ID d3986466) loses TBG ticks.  This causes the DOS/RTE/TSB system
       clock to run slowly, losing about one second per minute.  A workaround is
       to prevent "sim_interval" from going negative on return from "sim_idle".
       Issue 622 on the SIMH site describes the problem.

       instruction) to test the "cpu_configuration" variable for the presence of
       one of the three 1000 model flags.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The 21MX monikers are deprecated in favor of the 1000 designations.  See
       the "HP 1000 Series Naming History" on the back inside cover of the
       Technical Reference Handbook.

    2. The string descriptors are used by the "show_model" routine to print the
       CPU model numbers prior to appending "loader enabled" or "loader
       disabled" to the report.

    3. Each CPU option requires three modifiers.  The two regular modifiers
       control the setting and printing of the option, while the extended
       modifier controls clearing the option.  The latter is necessary because
       the option must be checked before confirming the change, and so the
       option value must be passed to the validation routine.

/* Simulation stop list.

   The simulator can be configured to detect certain machine instruction
   conditions and stop execution when one of them occurs.  Stops may be enabled
   or disabled individually with these commands:

     SET CPU STOP=<option>[;<option]
     SET CPU NOSTOP=<option>[;<option]

   The CPU stop table is used to parse the commands and set the appropriate
   variables to enable or disable the stops.


   Implementation notes:

    1. To avoid the testing of stop conditions at run time, they are implemented
       by setting individual stop status variables either to the appropriate
       stop code (if enabled) or to SCPE_OK (if disabled).  This allows the
       affected routines to return the status value unconditionally and cause
       either a simulator stop or continued execution without a run-time test.

    2. SCPE_IOERR is not actually returned for unreported I/O errors.  Instead,
       it is simply a flag that a stop code specific to the detected error
       should be returned.

    3. To permit stops to be bypassed for one instruction execution, routines
       use the STOP macro to return the value of the applicable stop variable
       ANDed with the complement of the value of the "cpu_ss_inhibit" variable.
       The latter is set in the instruction prelude to SS_INHIBIT (i.e., all
       ones) if a bypass is requested or to SCPE_OK (i.e., all zeros) if not,
       and is reset to SCPE_OK after each instruction execution.  The effect is
       that SCPE_OK is returned instead of a simulator stop if a stop condition
       occurs when a bypass is specified.  This action depends on the value of
       SCPE_OK being zero (which is guaranteed).

/* I/O signal tables.

   These tables contain the set of I/O signals that are appropriate for each I/O

   The first table defines the backplane signals generated by each I/O Group
   operation.  A signal set is sent to the device interface associated with the
   select code specified in an IOG instruction to direct the operation of the
   interface.  Backplane signals map closely to IOG instructions.  For example,
   the SFS instruction asserts the SFS backplane signal to the interface card.

   The hardware ENF and SIR signals are periodic.  In simulation, they are
   asserted only when the flag buffer or the flag and control flip-flops are
   changed, respectively.

   The second table defines the signals generated in addition to the explicitly
   asserted signal.  Specifically, asserting PON also asserts POPIO and CRS,
   and asserting POPIO also asserts CRS.  The ENF and SIR signals are asserted
   when necessary as described above.

/* I/O access table.

   I/O signals are directed to specific interface cards by specifying their
   locations in the I/O card cage.  Each location is assigned a number, called a
   select code, that is specified by I/O Group instructions to indicate the
   interface card to activate.

   In simulation, the select code corresponding to each interface is stored in
   the corresponding Device Information Block (DIB).  To avoid having to scan
   the device list each time an I/O instruction is executed, an I/O access table
   is filled in as part of I/O initialization in the instruction execution
   prelude.  The table is indexed by select code (00-77 octal) and contains
   pointers to the device and DIB structures associated with each index.

   Initialization is performed during each "sim_instr" call, as the select code
   assignments may have been changed by the user at the SCP prompt.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The entries for select codes 0 and 1 (the CPU and Overflow Register,
       respectively) are initialized here, as they are always present (i.e.,
       cannot be disabled) and cannot change.

    2. The table contains constant pointers, but "const" cannot be used here, as
       "hp_trace" calls "sim_dname", which takes a variable device pointer even
       though it does not change anything.

    3. The "references" entries are used only during table initialization to
       ensure that each select code is referenced by only one device.

/* Execute CPU instructions.

   This is the instruction decode routine for the HP 21xx/1000 simulator.  It is
   called from the simulator control program (SCP) to execute instructions in
   simulated memory, starting at the simulated program counter.  It runs until
   the status to be returned is set to a value other than SCPE_OK.

   On entry, P points to the instruction to execute, and the "sim_switches"
   global contains any command-line switches included with the RUN command.  On
   exit, P points at the next instruction to execute.

   Execution is divided into four phases.

   First, the instruction prelude configures the simulation state to resume
   execution.  This involves verifying that there are no device conflicts (e.g.,
   two devices with the same select code) and initializing the I/O state.  These
   actions accommodate reconfiguration of the I/O device settings and program
   counter while the simulator was stopped.  The prelude also checks for one
   command-line switch: if "-B" is specified, the current set of simulation stop
   conditions is bypassed for the first instruction executed.

   Second, the memory protect option is initialized.  MP aborts utilize the
   "setjmp/longjmp" mechanism to transfer control out of the instruction
   executors without returning through the call stack.  This allows an
   instruction to be aborted part-way through execution when continuation is
   impossible due to a memory access violation.  An MP abort returns to the main
   instruction loop at the "setjmp" routine.

   Third, the instruction execution loop decodes instructions and calls the
   individual executors in turn until a condition occurs that prevents further
   execution.  Examples of such conditions include execution of a HLT
   instruction, a user stop request (CTRL+E) from the simulation console, a
   recoverable device error (such as an improperly formatted tape image), a
   user-specified breakpoint, and a simulation stop condition (such as execution
   of an unimplemented instruction).  The execution loop also polls for I/O
   events and device interrupts, and runs DMA channel cycles.  During
   instruction execution, the IR register contains the currently executing
   instruction, and the P register points to the memory location containing the
   next instruction.

   Fourth, the instruction postlude updates the simulation state in preparation
   for returning to the SCP command prompt.  Devices that maintain an internal
   state different from their external state, such as the MEM status and
   violation registers, are updated so that their internal and external states
   are fully consistent.  This ensures that the state visible to the user during
   the simulation stop is correct.  It also ensures that the program counter
   points correctly at the next instruction to execute upon resumption.


   The instruction execution loop starts by checking for event timer expiration.
   If one occurs, the associated device's service routine is called by the
   "sim_process_event" routine.  Then a check for DMA service requests is made.
   If a request is active, the "dma_service" routine is called to process it.

   DMA cycles are requested by an I/O card asserting its SRQ signal.  If a DMA
   channel is programmed to respond to that card's select code, the channel's
   service request flag is set in the "dma_request_set".  On each pass through
   the instruction execution loop, "dma_request_set" is checked; if it is
   non-zero, a DMA cycle will be initiated.  A DMA cycle consists of a memory
   cycle and an I/O cycle.  These cycles are synchronized with the control
   processor on the 21xx CPUs.  On the 1000s, memory cycles are asynchronous,
   while I/O cycles are synchronous.  Memory cycle time is about 40% of the I/O
   cycle time.

   With properly designed interface cards, DMA is capable of taking consecutive
   I/O cycles.  On all machines except the 1000 M-Series, a DMA cycle freezes
   the CPU for the duration of the cycle.  On the M-Series, a DMA cycle freezes
   the CPU if it attempts an I/O cycle (including IAK) or a directly-interfering
   memory cycle.  An interleaved memory cycle is allowed.  Otherwise, the
   control processor is allowed to run.  Therefore, during consecutive DMA
   cycles, the M-Series CPU will run until an IOG instruction is attempted,
   whereas the other CPUs will freeze completely.  This is simulated by skipping
   instruction execution if "dma_request_set" is still non-zero after servicing
   the current request, i.e., if the device asserted SRQ again as a result of
   the DMA cycle.

   All DMA cards except the 12607B provide two independent channels.  If both
   channels are active simultaneously, channel 1 has priority for I/O cycles
   over channel 2.

   Most I/O cards assert SRQ no more than 50% of the time.  A few buffered
   cards, such as the 12821A and 13175A Disc Interfaces, are capable of
   asserting SRQ continuously while filling or emptying the buffer.  If SRQ for
   channel 1 is asserted continuously when both channels are active, then no
   channel 2 cycles will occur until channel 1 completes.

   After DMA servicing, a check for pending interrupt requests is made.

   Interrupt recognition in the HP 1000 CPU is controlled by three state
   variables: "interrupt_system", "cpu_interrupt_enable", and
   "interrupt_request".  "interrupt_system" corresponds to the INTSYS flip-flop
   in the 1000 CPU, "cpu_interrupt_enable" corresponds to the INTEN flip-flop,
   and "interrupt_request" corresponds to the NRMINT flip-flop.  STF 00 and CLF
   00 set and clear INTSYS, turning the interrupt system on and off.  Microcode
   instructions ION and IOFF set and clear INTEN, enabling or disabling certain
   interrupts.  An IRQ signal from a device, qualified by the corresponding PRH
   and IEN signals, will set NRMINT to request a normal interrupt; an IOFF or
   IAK will clear it.

   Under simulation, "interrupt_system" is controlled by STF/CLF 00.
   "cpu_interrupt_enable" is set or cleared as appropriate by the individual
   instruction simulators.  "interrupt_request" is set to the successfully
   interrupting device's select code, or to zero if there is no qualifying
   interrupt request.

   The rules controlling interrupt recognition are:

    1. Power fail (SC 04) may interrupt if "cpu_interrupt_enable" is set; this
       is not conditional on "interrupt_system" being set.

    2. Memory protect (SC 05) may interrupt if "interrupt_system" is set; this
       is not conditional on "cpu_interrupt_enable" being set.

    3. Parity error (SC 05) may interrupt always; this is not conditional on
       either "interrupt_system" or "cpu_interrupt_enable" being set.

    4. All other devices (SC 06 and up) may interrupt only if both
      "interrupt_system" and "cpu_interrupt_enable" are set.

   Qualification with "interrupt_system" is performed by the I/O dispatcher,
   which asserts IEN to the device interface if the interrupt system is on.  All
   interfaces other than Power Fail or Parity Error assert IRQ only if IEN is
   asserted.  If IEN is denied, i.e., the interrupt system is off, then only
   Power Fail and Parity Error will assert IRQ and thereby set the
   "interrupt_request" value to their respective select codes.  Therefore, we
   need only qualify by "cpu_interrupt_enable" here.

   At instruction fetch time, a pending interrupt request will be deferred if
   the previous instruction was a JMP indirect, JSB indirect, STC, CLC, STF,
   CLF, or, for a 1000-series CPU, an SFS, SFC, JRS, DJP, DJS, SJP, SJS, UJP, or
   UJS.  The executors for these instructions clear the "cpu_interrupt_enable"
   flag, which is then set unilaterally when each instruction is dispatched.
   The flag is also cleared by an interrupt acknowledgement, deferring
   additional interrupts until after the instruction in the trap cell is
   executed.

   On the HP 1000, an interrupt request is always deferred until after the
   current instruction completes.  On the 21xx, the request is deferred unless
   the current instruction is an MRG instruction other than JMP or JMP,I or
   JSB,I.  Note that for the 21xx, SFS and SFC are not included in the deferral
   criteria.  In simulation, the "reenable_interrupts" routine is called to
   handle this case.


   When a status other than SCPE_OK is returned from an instruction executor or
   event service routine, the instruction execution loop exits into the
   instruction postlude.  The set of debug trace flags is restored if it had
   been changed by an active execution trace or idle trace suppression.  This
   ensures that the simulation stop does not exit with the flags set improperly.
   If the simulation stopped for a programmed halt, the 21xx binary loader area
   is protected in case it had been unprotected to run the loader.  The MEU
   status and violation registers and the program counter queue pointer are
   updated to present the proper values to the user interface.  The default
   breakpoint type is updated to reflect the current MEU state (disabled, system
   map enabled, or user map enabled).  Finally, the P register is reset if the
   current instruction is to be reexecuted on reentry (for example, on an
   unimplemented instruction stop).


   Implementation notes:

    1. While the Microsoft VC++ "setjmp" documentation says, "All variables
       (except register variables) accessible to the routine receiving control
       contain the values they had when longjmp was called," the ISO C99
       standard says, "All accessible objects have values...as of the time the
       longjmp function was called, except that the values of objects of
       automatic storage duration that are local to the function containing the
       invocation of the corresponding setjmp macro that do not have
       volatile-qualified type and have been changed between the setjmp
       invocation and longjmp call are indeterminate."

       Therefore, the "exec_save" and "idle_save" variables are marked static
       to ensure that they are reloaded after a longjmp caused by a memory
       protect abort (they are not marked volatile to save redundant reloads
       within the instruction execution loop).  Also, "status" and "exec_test"
       are set before reentering the instruction loop after an abort.  This is
       done solely to reassure the compiler that the values are not clobbered,
       even though in both cases the values are reestablished after an abort
       before they are used.

    2. The C standard requires that the "setjmp" call be made from a frame that
       is still active (i.e., still on the stack) when "longjmp" is called.
       Consequently, we must call "setjmp" from this routine rather than a
       subordinate routine that will have exited (to return to this routine)
       when the "longjmp" call is made.

    3. The -P switch is removed from the set of command line switches to ensure
       that internal calls to the device reset routines are not interpreted as
       "power-on" resets.

    4. A CPU freeze is simulated by skipping instruction execution during the
       current loop cycle.

    5. The 1000 M-Series allows some CPU processing concurrently with
       continuous DMA cycles, whereas all other CPUs freeze.  The processor
       freezes if an I/O cycle is attempted, including an interrupt
       acknowledgement.  Because some microcode extensions (e.g., Access IOP,
       RTE-6/VM OS) perform I/O cycles, advance detection of I/O cycles is
       difficult.  Therefore, we freeze all processing for the M-Series as well.

    6. EXEC tracing is active when exec_save is non-zero.  "exec_save" saves the
       current state of the trace flags when an EXEC trace match occurs.  For
       this to happen, at least TRACE_EXEC must be set, so "exec_save" will be
       set non-zero when a match is active.

    7. The execution trace (TRACE_EXEC) match test is performed in two parts to
       display the register values both before and after the instruction
       execution.  Consequently, the enable test is done before the register
       trace, and the disable test is done after.

    8. A simulation stop bypass is inactivated after the first instruction
       execution by the expedient of setting the stop inhibition mask to the
       execution status result.  This must be SCPE_OK (i.e., zero) for execution
       to continue, which removes the stop inhibition.  If a non-zero status
       value is returned, then the inhibition mask will be set improperly, but
       that is irrelevant, as execution will stop in this case.

    9. In hardware, the IAK signal is asserted to all devices in the I/O card
       cage, as well as to the Memory Protect card.  Only the interrupting
       device will respond to IAK.  In simulation, IAK is dispatched to the
       interrupting device and, if that device is not the MP card, then to the
       MP device as well.

   10. In hardware, execution of the instruction in the trap cell does not use
       the FTCH micro-order to avoid changing the MP violation register during
       an MP interrupt.  In simulation, we use a Fetch classification to label
       the access correctly in a trace listing.  This is OK because the Enable
       Violation Register flip-flop has already been reset if this is an MP
       interrupt, so the Fetch will not alter the MP VR.

   11. The "meu_assert_IAK" routine sets the "meu_indicator" and "meu_page"
       values for the P register before switching to the system map.  Therefore,
       on return, they indicate the prior map and page in use when the interrupt
       occurred.

       used to decode the rest of the IOG instructions.  These instructions are
       differentiated by the A/B selector (bit 11).

    2. If a memory protect violation occurs, the IOG signal from the CPU to the
       I/O backplane is denied to disable all I/O signals.  For a LIA/B or MIA/B
       instruction, this will load or merge the value of the floating I/O bus
       into the A or B registers.  This value is zero on all machines.  Merging
       zero doesn't change the register value, so the only the LIA/B case must
       be explicitly checked.

/* Resolve an indirect address.

   This routine resolves a possibly indirect memory address into a direct
   address by following an indirect chain, if any.  On entry, the M register
   contains the address to resolve, and the "interruptible" parameter is set to
   TRUE if the instruction is interruptible or FALSE if it is not.  On exit, the
   M register contains the direct address, and SCPE_OK is returned.  If an
   interrupt is pending and permitted, NOTE_INDINT is returned to abort the
   instruction.  If the indirect chain length is greater than the chain limit,
   STOP_INDIR is returned to abort execution.  In both abort cases, the M
   register content is undefined.

   Logical memory addresses are 15 bits wide, providing direct access to a 32K
   logical address space.  Addresses may also be indirect, with bit 15 (the MSB)
   serving as the direct/indirect indicator.  An indirect address may point at
   either a direct or indirect address.  In the latter case, the chain is
   followed until a direct address is obtained.

   Indirect addressing has implications for interrupt handling.  Normally,
   interrupts are checked at each level of indirection, and if one is pending,
   the CPU will abort execution of the instruction and then service the
   interrupt.  On return from the interrupt handler, the instruction will be
   restarted.

   Detection of interrupts is dependent on the Interrupt Enable flip-flop being
   set.  Certain instructions, such as JMP indirect, JSB indirect, and most IOG
   instructions, clear the enable flag to hold off interrupts until the current
   and following instructions complete, including complete resolution of the
   indirect chain.  If the chain is unresolvable (i.e., it points to itself, as
   in the instruction sequence JMP *+1,I and DEF *,I), then interrupts are held
   off forever.

   To prevent a user program from freezing a protected OS with an infinite
   indirect chain, and to permit real-time interrupts to be handled while
   resolving a long indirect chain, the Memory Protect accessory counts indirect
   levels during address resolution and will reenable interrupt recognition
   after the third level.  Operating systems that run without MP installed are
   subject to freezing as above, but those employing MP will be able to regain
   control from an infinite indirect chain.

   In simulation, the SET CPU INDIR=<limit> command sets the maximum number of
   levels; the default is 16.  If the level is exceeded during address
   resolution, the simulator will stop.  The maximum limit is 32768, which is
   the maximum possible address chain without an infinite loop, but an indirect
   chain over a few levels deep almost certainly represents a programming error.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Virtually all valid indirect references are one level deep, so we
       optimize for this case.  Also, we protect against entry with a direct
       address by simply returning the address, but the overhead can be saved by
       calling this routine only for indirect addresses.

    2. The 12892B Memory Protect accessory jumper W6 ("INT") controls whether
       pending interrupts with the Interrupt Enable flip-flop clear are serviced
       immediately (jumper removed) or after three levels of indirection (jumper
       installed).  If the jumper is removed, MP must be enabled (control
       flip-flop set) for the interrupt disable to be overridden.

       The jumper state need not be checked here, however, because this routine
       can be entered with an interrupt pending, i.e., "interrupt_request" is
       non-zero, only if "cpu_interrupt_enable" and "mp_reenable_interrupts" are
       both false.  If either is true, the pending interrupt would have been
       serviced before calling the instruction executor that caleld this routine
       to resolve its address.  For "mp_reenable_interrupts" to return false,
       the INT jumper must be installed or the MP control flip-flop must be
       clear.

    3. When employing the indirect counter, the hardware clears a pending
       interrupt deferral after the third level of indirection and aborts the
       instruction after the fourth.

    4. The JRS, DJP, DJS, SJP, SJS, UJP, and UJS instructions also hold off
       interrupts for three indirect levels, but they count levels internally
       and do not depend on the presence of the MP accessory to reenable
       interrupt recognition.  However, DMS requires MP, so simulation uses the
       MP indirect counter for these instructions as well.

    5. In hardware, it is possible to execute an instruction with an infinite
       indirect loop (e.g., JMP *+1,I and DEF *,I).  If MP is not installed,
       this freezes the CPU with interrupts disabled until HALT is pressed.  In
       simulation, the instruction executes until the indirect limit is reached,
       whereupon the simulator stops with "Indirect address loop" status.
       Modelling the hardware CPU freeze would be difficult, as the simulation
       console would have to be polled locally to watch for CTRL+E (the
       simulation equivalent of the CPU front panel HALT button).

    6. In hardware, all instructions that resolve indirects are interruptible.
       In simulation, some instruction executors are not written to handle an
       instruction abort (e.g., the P register is not backed up properly to
       rerun the instruction); these will pass FALSE for the "interruptible"
       parameter.

   to back up the P register to rerun the instruction.

/* Install a bootstrap loader into memory.

   This routine copies the bootstrap loader specified by "boot" into the last 64
   words of main memory, limited by a 32K memory size.  If "sc" contains the
   select code of an I/O interface (i.e., select code 10 or above), this routine
   will configure the I/O instructions in the loader to the supplied select
   code.  On exit, the P register will be set to point at the loader starting
   program address, and the S register will be altered as directed by the
   "sr_clear" and "sr_set" masks if the current CPU is a 1000.  The updated P
   register value is returned to the caller.

   The currently configured CPU family (21xx or 1000) determines which of two
   BOOT_LOADER structures is accessed from the "boot" array.  Each structure
   contains the 64-word loader array and three indicies into the loader
   array that specify the start of program execution, the element containing the
   DMA control word, and the element containing the (negative) address of the
   first loader word in memory.

   21xx-series loaders consist of subsections handling one or two devices.  A
   two-part loader is indicated by a starting program index other than 0, i.e.,
   other than the beginning of the loader.  An example is the Basic Moving-Head
   Disc Loader (BMDL), which consists of a paper tape loader section starting at
   index 0 and a disc loader section starting at index 50 octal.  For these
   loaders, I/O configuration depends on the "start_index" field of the selected
   BOOTSTRAP structure: I/O instructions before the starting index are
   configured to the current paper-tape reader select code, and instructions at
   or after the starting index are configured to the device select code
   specified by "sc".  Single-part loaders specify a starting index of 0, and
   all I/O instructions are configured to the "sc" select code.

   1000-series loaders are always single part and always start at index 0, so
   they are always configured to use the "sc" select code.

   If a given device does not have both a 21xx-series and a 1000-series loader,
   the "start_index" field of the undefined loader will be set to the "IBL_NA"
   value.  If this routine is called to copy an undefined loader, it will reject
   the call by returning a starting address of zero to the caller.  In this
   case, neither P nor S are changed.

   If I/O configuration is requested, each instruction in the loader array is
   examined as it is copied.  If the instruction is a non-HLT I/O instruction
   referencing a select code >= 10, the select code will be reset by subtracting
   10 and adding the value of the select code supplied by the "sc" parameter (or
   the paper-tape reader select code, as above).  This permits configuration of
   loaders that address two- or three-card interfaces.  Passing an "sc" value of
   0 will inhibit configuration, and the loader array will be copied verbatim.

   As an example, passing an "sc" value of 24 octal will alter these I/O-group
   instructions as follows:

        Loader    Configured
     Instruction  Instruction  Note
     -----------  -----------  ------------------------------
       OTA 10       OTA 24     Normal configuration
       LIA 11       LIA 25     Second card configuration
       STC  6       STC  6     DCPC configuration not changed
       HLT 11       HLT 11     Halt instruction not changed

   If configuration is performed, two additional operations may be performed.
   First, the routine will alter the word at the index specified by the
   "dma_index" field of the selected BOOTSTRAP structure unconditionally as
   above.  This word is assumed to contain a DMA control word; it is configured
   to reference the supplied select code.  Second, it will set the word at the
   index specified by the "fwa_index" field to the two's-complement of the
   starting address of the loader in memory.  This value may be used by the
   loader to check that it will not be overwritten by loaded data.

   If either field is set to the IBL_NA value, then the corresponding
   modification is not made.  For example, the 21xx Basic Binary Loader (BBL)
   does not use DMA, so its "dma_index" field is set to IBL_NA, and so no DMA
   control word modification is done.

   The starting address for loader execution is derived from the "start_index"
   field and the starting memory address to which the loader is copied.

   Finally, if the current CPU is a 1000-series machine, the S register bits
   corresponding to those set in the "sr_clear" value are masked off, and the
   bits corresponding to those in the "sr_set" value are set.  In addition, the
   select code from the "sc" value is shifted left and ORed into the value.
   This action presets the S-register to the correct value for the selected
   loader.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The paper-tape reader's select code is determined on each entry to the
       routine to accommodate select code reassignment by the user.

   status to the CPU.  For example, while the paper tape punch returns low- or
   out-of-tape status, the paper tape reader gives no indication that a tape is
   loaded.  If the reader is commanded to read when no tape is mounted, the
   interface hangs while waiting for the handshake with the device to complete.

   In hardware, the CPU can detect this condition only by timing the operation
   and concluding that the tape is missing if the timeout is exceeded.  However,
   if an IOERR stop has been set, then the simulator will stop with an error
   message to permit the condition to be fixed.  For instance, attempting to
   read from the paper tape reader with no paper tape image file attached will
   print "No tape loaded in the PTR device" and will stop the simulator.

   Such devices will call this routine and pass a pointer to the unit that
   encountered the error condition.  The routine returns TRUE and saves the
   pointer to the failing unit if the IOERR stop is enabled, and FALSE
   otherwise.

   This routine calls the I/O interface handler of the device corresponding to
   the supplied "select_code" value, passing the "inbound_signals" and
   "inbound_value" to the interface.  The combined skip status and outbound data
   value from the handler is returned to the caller.

   The 21xx/1000 I/O structure requires that no empty slots exist between
   interface cards.  This is due to the hardware priority chaining (PRH/PRL)
   that is passed from card-to-card.  If it is necessary to leave unused I/O
   slots, HP 12777A Priority Jumper Cards must be installed in them to maintain
   priority continuity.

   Under simulation, every unassigned I/O slot behaves as though a 12777A were
   resident.  In this configuration, I/O instructions addressed to one of these
   slots read the floating bus for LIA/B and MIA/B instructions or do nothing
   for all other instructions.

   If the slot is occupied, then the routine first determines the rank (0 or 1)
   and bit (0 to 31) corresponding to the select code of the interface.  These
   will be used to access the interrupt, priority, and service request bit
   vectors.  Then it augments the supplied inbound signals set with IEN if the
   interrupt system flip-flop is set, and PRH if no higher priority interface is
   denying PRL.

   In hardware, PRH of each interface is connected to PRL of the next higher
   priority (lower select code) interface, so that a PRH-to-PRL chain is formed.
   An interface receives PRH if every higher-priority interface is asserting
   PRL.  When an interface denies PRL, each lower-priority interface has PRH
   denied and so denies PRL to the next interface in the chain.

   To avoid checking calling each device simulator's higher-priority interface
   routine to ascertain its PRL status, the priority holdoff bit vector is
   checked.  This vector has a bit set for each interface currently denying PRL.
   The check is made as in the following example:

     sc bit      :  ...0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   (dispatching to SC 11)
     sc bit - 1  :  ...0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   (PRH required thru SC 10)
     pri holdoff :  ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (PRL denied for SC 06 and 11)
     ANDed value :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (PRL blocked at SC 06)

   If the ANDed value is 0, then there are no higher priority devices in this
   rank that are denying PRL.  If the rank is 0, then PRH is asserted to the
   current select code.  If the rank is 1, then PRH is asserted only if all rank
   0 priority holdoff bits are zero, i.e., if no rank 0 interfaces are denying
   PRL.

   The device interface handler is obtained from the "dibs" array, and the
   interface is called to process the inbound signals.

   On return, the outbound signals from the interface are examined.  The
   interrupt vector bit is set to the state of the IRQ signal, and the priority
   vector bit is set to the state of the PRL signal.

   If the IRQ signal is present, then the interface is the highest priority
   device requesting an interrupt (otherwise the interface would not have
   received PRH, which is a term in asserting IRQ), so the select code of the
   interrupting device is set.  Otherwise, if the interface asserted its PRL
   condition from a prior denied state, then lower priority devices are checked
   to see if any now have a valid interrupt request.

   If the SRQ signal is asserted, a DMA request is made; if the device is under
   DMA control, a DMA cycle will be initiated at the start of the next pass
   through the instruction execution loop.  Finally, the skip condition is set
   if the SKF signal is asserted, and the skip state and outbound value from the
   interface are returned to the caller.


   Implementation notes:

    1. For select codes < 10 octal, an IOI signal reads the floating S-bus
       (high on the 1000, low on the 21xx).  For select codes >= 10 octal, an
       IOI reads the floating I/O bus (low on all machines).

    2. The last select code used is saved for use by the CPU I/O handler in
       detecting consecutive CLC 0 executions.

    3. The IRQ and FLG signals always assert together on HP 21xx/1000 machines.
       They are physically tied together on all interface cards, and the CPUs
       depend on their concurrent assertion for correct operation.  In
       simulation, we check only IRQ from the interface, although FLG will be
       asserted as well.

    4. The IRQ and SRQ signals usually assert together, which means that an
       interrupt is pending before the DMA request is serviced.  However, DMA
       cycles always assert CLF, which clears the interrupt request before
       interrupts are checked.  In hardware, an SRQ to an active channel asserts
       DMALO (DMA lock out), which inhibits IRQ from setting the interrupt
       request flip-flop until the DMA cycle completes.  In simulation, IRQ is
       never asserted because the CLF is processed by the interface simulator
       before IRQ is determined.

    5. An interface will assert "cnVALID" if the conditional PRL and IRQ were
       determined.  If "cnVALID" is not asserted by the interface, then the
       states of the "cnPRL" and "cnIRQ" signals cannot be inferred from their
       presence or absence in the outbound signal set.

    6. The "cnVALID" pseudo-signal is required because although most interfaces
       determine the PRL and IRQ states in response to an SIR assertion, not all
       do.  In particular, the 12936A Privileged Interrupt Fence determines PRL
       in response to an IOO signal.

/* Poll for a new interrupt request.

   This routine is called when an interface asserts a previously denied PRL
   signal, i.e., when PRL goes from low to high on the I/O backplane.  It
   determines if any interfaces lower in the priority chain are now ready to
   interrupt.  If so, the select code of the highest priority interrupting
   interface is returned; otherwise, 0 is returned.

   In hardware, PRH and PRL form a priority chain that extends from interface to
   interface on the backplane.  For an interface to generate an interrupt, PRH
   must be asserted by the next-higher-priority interface.  An interface
   receiving PRH asserts IRQ to request an interrupt, and it denies PRL to
   prevent lower-priority devices from interrupting.  IRQ is cleared by an
   interrupt acknowledge (IAK) signal.  PRL generally remains low while a
   device's interrupt service routine is executing to prevent preemption.

   IRQ and PRL indicate one of four possible states for a device:

     IRQ  PRL  Device state
     ---  ---  ----------------------
      0    1   Not interrupting
      1    0   Interrupt requested
      0    0   Interrupt acknowledged
      1    1   (not allowed)

   PRL must be denied when requesting an interrupt (IRQ asserted).  This is a
   hardware requirement of the 21xx/1000 series.  The IRQ lines from the
   backplane are not priority encoded.  Instead, the PRL chain expresses the
   priority by allowing only one IRQ line to be active at a time.  This allows a
   simple pull-down encoding of the CIR inputs.

   When a given interface denies PRL, the PRH-to-PRL chain through all
   lower-priority interfaces also denies.  When that interface reasserts PRL,
   the chain reasserts through intervening interfaces until it reaches one that
   is ready to request an interrupt or through all interfaces if none are ready.
   An interface that is ready to interrupt except for a denied PRH will assert
   IRQ when the higher-priority PRH-to-PRL chain reasserts.

   A direct simulation of this hardware behavior would require polling all
   lower-priority interfaces in order by calling their interface routines,
   asserting PRH to each, and checking each for an asserted IRQ or a denied PRL
   in response.  Two avoid this inefficiency, two bit vectors are kept that
   reflect the states of each interface's IRQ and PRL signals conditional on PRH
   being asserted.  The "interrupt_request_set" bit vector reflects each
   interface's readiness to interrupt if its associated PRH signal is asserted,
   and the "priority_holdoff_set" reflects the (inverted) state of each
   interface's PRL signal, i.e., a zero-bit indicates that the interface is
   ready to assert PRL if its associated PRH signal is asserted.  Each vector is
   represented as a two-element array of 32-bit unsigned integers, forming a
   64-bit vector in which bits 0-31 of the first element correspond to select
   codes 00-37 octal, and bits 0-31 of the second element correspond to select
   codes 40-77 octal.

   The routine begins by seeing if an interrupt is pending.  If not, it returns
   0.  Otherwise, the PRH-to-PRL chain is checked to see if PRL is denied
   anywhere upstream of the highest priority interrupting interface.  If it is,
   then no interface can interrupt.  If all higher-priority PRL signals are
   asserted, then the interrupt request of that interface is granted.

   Recognition of interrupts depends on the current state of the interrupt
   system and interrupt enable flip-flops, as follows:

     INTSYS  INTEN   Interrupts Recognized
     ------  ------  ----------------------------
     CLEAR   CLEAR   Parity error
     CLEAR   SET     Parity error, power fail
     SET     CLEAR   Parity error, memory protect
     SET     SET     All sources

   Memory protect and parity error share select code 05, but the interrupt
   sources are differentiated on the MP card -- setting the flag buffer for a
   memory protect violation is qualified by the IEN signal that reflects
   the INTSYS state, whereas no qualification is used for a parity error.
   Therefore, an interrupt on select code 05 with the interrupt system off must
   be a parity error interrupt.

   The end of the priority chain is marked by the highest-priority
   (lowest-order) bit that is set.  We calculate a priority mask by ANDing the
   the PRL bits with its two's complement using the IOPRIORITY macro.  Only the
   lowest-order bit will differ.  For example:

     pri holdoff :  ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (PRL denied for SC 06 and 11)
     one's compl :  ...1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
     two's compl :  ...1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
     ANDed value :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (chain is broken at SC 06)

   The interrupt requests are then ANDed with the priority masks to determine if
   a request is pending:

     pri mask    :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (allowed interrupt source)
     int request :  ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (interfaces asserting IRQ)
     ANDed value :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (request to grant)

   The select code corresponding to the granted request is then returned to the
   caller.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Recognition of an interrupt in the second half of the request set (i.e.,
       for select codes 40-77 octal) occurs only if the priority set for the
       first half is 0, i.e., if the PRH-to-PRL chain is unbroken through select
       code 37.

    2. If an interrupt for select codes 00-37 is pending but is inhibited, then
       all higher select code interrupts are inhibited as well, so we only need
       to check requests for the lower half or the upper half, but not both.

    3. Splitting the interrupt request and priority holdoff sets into two 32-bit
       parts is actually more efficient on 32-bit host CPUs than using a single
       64-bit set, especially when right-shifting to obtain the bit number.
       Efficiency is also aided by the fact that interface select codes are
       typically below 40 octal and therefore are represented in the first bit
       set(s).

   I/O operations directed to select code 0 manipulate the interrupt system.
   STF and CLF turn the interrupt system on and off, and SFS and SFC test the
   state of the interrupt system.  When the interrupt system is off, only Power
   Fail and Parity Error interrupts are allowed.  The PRL signal follows the
   state of the interrupt system.

   CLC asserts CRS to all interfaces from select code 6 upward.

   A PON reset initializes certain CPU registers.  The 1000 series does a
   microcoded memory clear and leaves the T and P registers set as a result.


   Implementation notes:

    1. An IOI signal reads the floating I/O bus (0 on all machines).

    2. A CLC 0 issues CRS to all devices, not CLC.  While most cards react
       identically to CRS and CLC, some do not, e.g., the 12566B when used as an
       I/O diagnostic target.

    3. RTE uses the undocumented SFS 0,C instruction to both test and turn off
       the interrupt system.  This is confirmed in the "RTE-6/VM Technical
       Specifications" manual (HP 92084-90015), section 2.3.1 "Process the
       Interrupt", subsection "A.1 $CIC":

        "Test to see if the interrupt system is on or off.  This is done with
         the SFS 0,C instruction.  In either case, turn it off (the ,C does
         it)."

       ...and in section 5.8, "Parity Error Detection":

        "Because parity error interrupts can occur even when the interrupt
         system is off, the code at $CIC must be able to save the complete
         system status.  The major hole in being able to save the complete state
         is in saving the interrupt system state.  In order to do this in both
         the 21MX and the 21XE the instruction 103300 was used to both test the
         interrupt system and turn it off."

    4. Select code 0 cannot interrupt, so the SIR handler does not assert IRQ.

    5. To guarantee proper initialization, the 12920A terminal multiplexer
       requires that the Control Reset (CRS) I/O signal be asserted for a
       minimum of 100 milliseconds.  In practice, this is achieved by executing
       131,072 (128K) CLC 0 instructions in a tight loop.  This is not necessary
       in simulation, and in fact is detrimental, as 262,000+ trace lines will
       be written for each device that enables IOBUS tracing.  To avoid this,
       consecutive CLC 0 operations after the first are omitted.  This is
       detected by checking the select code and signal set of the last I/O
       operation.

   Asserting IOI to select code 4 reads the Central Interrupt Register value.

/* Reset the CPU.

   This routine is called for a RESET, RESET CPU, RUN, or BOOT CPU command.  It
   is the simulation equivalent of an initial power-on condition (corresponding
   to PON, POPIO, and CRS signal assertion in the CPU) or a front-panel PRESET
   button press (corresponding to POPIO and CRS assertion).  SCP delivers a
   power-on reset to all devices when the simulator is started.

   If this is the first call after simulator startup, the initial memory array
   is allocated, the SCP-required program counter pointer is set to point to the
   REG array element corresponding to the P register, and the default CPU and
   memory size configuration is set.  In addition, the loader ROM sockets of the
   1000-series CPUs are populated with the initial ROM set, and the Basic Binary
   Loader (BBL) is installed in the protected memory (the upper 64 words of the
   defined memory size) of the 2116.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Setting the sim_PC value at run time accommodates changes in the register
       order automatically.  A fixed setting runs the risk of it not being
       updated if a change in the register order is made.

    2. The initial set of installed HP 1000 boot loader ROMs is:

/* Device boot routine.

   This routine is called by the BOOT CPU and LOAD CPU commands to copy the
   specified boot loader ROM program into the upper 64 words of the logical
   address space.  It is equivalent to pressing the IBL (Initial Binary Loader)
   button on the front panel of a 1000 M/E/F-Series CPU.

   On entry, the S register must be set to indicate the specific boot loader ROM
   and the associated device select code to be copied, as follows:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | ROM # | -   - |      select code      | -   -   -   -   -   - |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Bits 15-14 select one of four loader ROM sockets on the CPU board that may
   contain ROMs.  If the specified socket does, the contents of the ROM are
   copied into the upper 64 words of memory and configured to use the specified
   select code.  The unspecified bits of the S register are available for use by
   the bootstrap program.

   If the select code is less than 10 octal, the loader is not copied, and the
   O (overflow) register is set to 1.  A successful copy and configuration
   clears the O register.

   The 21xx-series CPUs do not provide the IBL function.  If this routine is
   invoked while the CPU is configured as one of these machines, the command is
   rejected.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, a non-existent ROM (i.e., an empty socket) reads as though
       all words contain 177777 octal.  This would result in the loader area of
       memory containing 62 all-ones words, followed by a word set to 177777 +
       SC - 000010, where SC is the configured select code, followed by a word
       set to the negative starting address of the loader.  This is not
       simulated; instead, an attempt to boot from an empty socket is rejected
       with "Non-existent device."

/* Change the CPU memory size.

   This validation routine is called to configure the CPU memory size.  The
   "new_size" parameter is set to the size desired and will be one of the
   discrete sizes supported by the simulator.  The "uptr" parameter points to
   the CPU unit and is used to obtain the CPU model.  The other parameters are
   not used.

   The routine processes commands of the form:

     SET [-F] CPU <memsize>

   If the new memory size is larger than the supported size for the CPU model
   currently selected, the routine returns an error.  If the new size is smaller
   than the previous size, and if the area that would be lost contains non-zero
   data, the user is prompted to confirm that memory should be truncated.  If
   the user denies the request, the change is rejected.  Otherwise, the new size
   is set.  The user may omit the confirmation request and force truncation by
   specifying the "-F" switch on the command line.

   On a 21xx CPU, the last 64 words in memory are reserved for the binary
   loader.  Before changing the memory size, the current loader is copied to the
   shadow RAM to preserve any manual changes that were made.  Then the new
   memory size is set, with the beginning of the loader area set as the first
   word of non-existent memory.

   Finally, non-existent memory is zeroed, so that the mem_read routine does not
   need any special handling for addresses beyond the end of defined memory.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, reads from non-existent memory return zero, and writes are
       ignored.  In simulation, the largest possible memory is instantiated and
       initialized to zero.  Therefore, only writes need to be checked against
       memory size.

    2. On the 21xx machines, doing SET CPU LOADERDISABLE decreases available
       memory size by 64 words.

   This validation routine is called to configure the CPU model.  The
   "new_model" parameter is set to the unit flag corresponding to the model
   desired.  The "uptr" parameter points to the CPU unit.  The other parameters
   are not used.

   Validation starts by setting the new memory size.  If the current memory size
   is within the range of memory sizes permitted by the new CPU model, it is
   kept; otherwise, it is reduced to the maximum size permitted.  If memory is
   to be truncated, the "set_size" routine verifies either that it is blank
   (i.e., filled with zero values) or that the user confirms that truncation is
   allowable.

   If the new memory size is accepted, the CPU options are set to the typical
   configuration supported by the new model.  Memory Protect and DMA are then
   configured as specified by the CPU feature table.  Memory expansion is
   enabled if the DMS instruction set is present.  Finally, the "is_1000" flag
   and memory reserved for the binary loader are set as directed by the new
   model.

   On return, the "cpu_configuration" bit set is updated to indicate the new
   model configuration.


   Implementation notes:

    1. "cpu_configuration" is used by the symbolic examine and deposit routines
       and instruction tracing to determine whether the firmware implementing a
       given opcode is present.  It is a copy of the CPU unit option flags with
       the encoded CPU model decoded into model flag bits.  This allows a simple
       (and fast) AND operation with a firmware feature word to determine
       applicability, saving the multiple masks and comparisons that would
       otherwise be required.

    2. The 'is_1000" variable is used to index into tables where the row
       selected depends on whether or not the CPU is a 1000 M/E/F-series model.
       For logical tests that depend on this, it is faster (by one x86 machine
       instruction) to test the "cpu_configuration" variable for the presence of
       one of the three 1000 model flags.

/* Enable or disable the 21xx binary loader.

   The 21xx CPUs store their initial binary loaders in the last 64 words of
   available memory.  This memory is protected by a LOADER ENABLE switch on the
   front panel.  When the switch is off (disabled), main memory effectively ends
   64 locations earlier, i.e., the loader area is treated as non-existent.
   Because these are core machines, the loader is retained when system power is
   off.

   1000 CPUs do not have a protected loader feature.  Instead, loaders are
   stored in PROMs and are copied into main memory for execution by the IBL
   switch.

   Under simulation, we keep both a total configured memory size (mem_size) and
   a current configured memory size (mem_end = "first word address of
   non-existent memory").  When the two are equal, the loader is enabled.  When
   the current size is less than the total size, the loader is disabled.

   Disabling the loader copies the last 64 words to a shadow array, zeros the
   corresponding memory, and decreases the last word of addressable memory by
   64.  Enabling the loader reverses this process.

   Disabling may be done manually by user command or automatically when a halt
   instruction is executed.  Enabling occurs only by user command.  This differs
   slightly from actual machine operation, which additionally disables the
   loader when a manual halt is performed.  We do not do this to allow
   breakpoints within and single-stepping through the loaders.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, reads from non-existent memory return zero.  In simulation,
       the largest possible memory is instantiated and initialized to zero, so
       that reads need not be checked against memory size.  To preserve this
       model for the protected loader, we save and then zero the memory area
       when the loader is disabled.

   installs the device loader ROM into the socket corresponding to the position

   corresponding device name or by supplying fewer than four device names.

   Loader ROMs may only be altered if the current CPU model is a 1000-series
   machine, and a device must be bootable and have a loader ROM assigned, or the
   command will be rejected.  A rejected command does not alter any of the ROM
   assignments.

   command will be rejected.

   newline to the output before returning.


   Implementation notes:

    1. SCP does not honor the status return from display routines, so we must
       explicitly print the rejection error message if the routine is called for
       a non-1000 CPU.

    2. sim_dname is called instead of using dptr->name directly to ensure that
       we pick up assigned logical device names.

/* Execute one machine instruction.

   This routine executes the CPU instruction present in the IR.  The CPU state
   (registers, memory, interrupt status) is modified as necessary, and the
   routine return SCPE_OK if the instruction executed successfully.  Any other
   status indicates that execution should cease, and control should return to
   the simulator console.  For example, a programmed HALT instruction returns
   STOP_HALT status.

   This routine implements the main instruction dispatcher.  Instructions
   corresponding to the MRG, SRG, and ASG are executed inline.  IOG, EAG, and
   UIG instructions are executed by external handlers.

   The JMP instruction executor handles CPU idling.  The 21xx/1000 CPUs have no
   "wait for interrupt" instruction.  Idling in HP operating systems consists of
   sitting in "idle loops" that end with JMP instructions.  We test for certain
   known patterns when a JMP instruction is executed to decide if the simulator
   should idle.

   Idling must not occur if an interrupt is pending.  As mentioned before, the
   CPU will defer pending interrupts when certain instructions are executed.  OS
   interrupt handlers exit via such deferring instructions.  If there is a
   pending interrupt when the OS is otherwise idle, the idle loop will execute
   one instruction before reentering the interrupt handler.  If we call
   sim_idle() in this case, we will lose interrupts.

   Consider the situation in RTE.  Under simulation, the TTY and TBG events are
   co-scheduled, so their event routines are called sequentially during a single
   "sim_process_event" call.  If the TTY has received an input character from
   the console poll, then both devices are ready to interrupt.  Assume that the
   TTY has priority.  When the TTY interrupts, $CIC in RTE is entered.  The TBG
   interrupt is held off through the JSB $CIC,I / JMP $CIC0,I / SFS 0,C
   instruction entry sequence, which defers interrupts until the interrupt
   system is turned off.  When $CIC returns via $IRT, one instruction of the
   idle loop is executed, even though the TBG interrupt is still pending,
   because the UJP instruction used to return also defers interrupts.

   If "sim_idle" is called at this point, the simulator will sleep when it
   should be handling the pending TBG interrupt.  When it awakes, TTY expiration
   will be moved forward to the next instruction.  The still-pending TBG
   interrupt will then be recognized, and $CIC will be entered.  But the TTY and
   TBG will then expire and attempt to interrupt again, although they are
   deferred by the $CIC entry sequence.  This causes the second TBG interrupt to
   be missed, as processing of the first one is just now being started.

   Similarly, at the end of the TBG handling, the TTY interrupt is still
   pending.  When $IRT returns to the idle loop, "sim_idle" would be called
   again, so the TTY and then TBG interrupt a third time.  Because the second
   TTY interrupt is still pending, $CIC is entered, but the third TTY interrupt
   is lost.

   We solve this problem by testing for a pending interrupt before calling
   "sim_idle".  The system isn't really quiescent if it is just about to handle
   an interrupt.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Instruction decoding is based on the HP 1000, which does a 256-way branch
       on the upper eight bits of the instruction, as follows:

         15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  Instruction Group
         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -------------------------------------------
          x  n  n  n  x  x  x  x  Memory Reference (n n n not equal to 0 0 0)
          0  0  0  0  x  0  x  x  Shift-Rotate
          0  0  0  0  x  1  x  x  Alter-Skip
          1  0  0  0  x  1  x  x  I/O
          1  0  0  0  0  0  x  0  Extended Arithmetic
          1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  divide (decoded as 100400)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  double load (decoded as 104000)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  double store (decoded as 104400)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  Extended Instruction 0 (A/B is set)
          1  0  0  0  x  0  1  1  Extended Instruction 1 (A/B is ignored)

    2. JSB is tricky.  It is possible to generate both an MP and a DM violation
       simultaneously, as the MP and MEM cards validate in parallel.  Consider a
       JSB to a location under the MP fence and on a write-protected page.  This
       situation must be reported as a DM violation, because it has priority
       (SFS 5 and SFC 5 check only the MEVFF, which sets independently of the MP
       fence violation).  Under simulation, this means that DM violations must
       be checked, and the MEVFF must be set, before an MP abort is taken.  This
       is done by the "mp_check_jmp" routine.

    3. Although MR (and TR) will be changed by reads of an indirect chain, the
       idle loop JMP will be direct, and so MR will contain the correct value
       for the "idle loop omitted" trace message.

    4. The Alter-Skip Group RSS micro-op reverses the skip sense of the SEZ,
       SSA/SSB, SLA/SLB, and SZA/SZB micro-op tests.  Normally, the instruction
       skips if any test is true.  However, the specific combination of SSA/SSB,
       SLA/SLB, and RSS micro-ops causes a skip if BOTH of the skip cases are
       true, i.e., if both the MSB and LSB of the register value are ones.  We
       handle this as a special case, because without RSS, the instruction skips
       if EITHER the MSB or LSB is zero.  The other reversed skip cases (SEZ,RSS
       and SZA,RSS/SZB,RSS) are independent.

   Memory references are contained in bits 15, 10, and 9-0 of instructions in
   the Memory Reference Group.  Bits 9-0 specify one of 1024 locations within
   either the base page (if bit 10 is 0) or the current page (if bit 10 is 1).
   If bit 15 is 0, the address is direct.  If bit 15 is 1, then the address is
   indirect and specifies the location containing the target address.  That
   address itself may be direct or indirect as indicated by bit 15, with bits
   14-0 specifying a location within the 32K logical address space.

   On entry, the instruction register (IR) contains the MRG instruction to
   resolve, and the memory address register (MR) contains the address of the
   instruction.  This routine examines the instruction; if the address is
   direct, then the full 15-bit address is returned in the MR register.
   Otherwise, the indirect chain is followed until the address is direct, a
   pending interrupt is recognized, or the length of the indirect address chain
   exceeds the alllowable limit.  The resulting direct address is returned in
   the MR register.

/* Execute a Shift-Rotate Group micro-operation.

   SRG instructions consist of two shift/rotate micro-operations plus a CLE and
   a SLA/SLB micro-op.  This routine implements the shift and rotate operation.

   Each of the two shift-rotate operations has an enable bit that must be set to
   enable the operation.  If the bit is not set, the operation is a NOP, with
   the exception that an ELA/ELB or ERA/ERB operation alters the E register (but
   not the A/B register).  We accommodate this by including the enable/disable
   bit with the three-bit operation code and decode the disabled operations of
   ELA/ELB and ERA/ERB separately from their enabled operations.

   On entry, "value" is the value of the selected accumulator (A/B), and
   "operation" is the micro-op and enable bit.  The routine returns the updated
   accumulator value and modifies the E register as indicated.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The enable bit is located adjacent to the three-bit encoded operation for
       the first shift-rotate micro-op, but it is spaced one bit away from the
       encoded operation for the second micro-op.  It is faster to decode
       separate values for each location rather than move the second enable bit
       adjacent to its encoded operation.  The former imposes no time penalty;
       the jump table for the "switch" statement is simply somewhat larger.

/* Reenable interrupt recognition.

   Certain instructions clear the "cpu_interrupt_enable" flag to defer
   recognition of pending interrupts until the succeeding instruction completes.
   However, the interrupt deferral rules differ for the 21xx vs. the 1000.

   The 1000 always defers until the completion of the instruction following the
   deferring instruction.  The 21xx defers unless the following instruction is
   an MRG instruction other than JMP or JMP,I or JSB,I.  If it is, then the
   deferral is inhibited, i.e., the pending interrupt will be recognized.

   In either case, if the interrupting device is the memory protect card, or if
   the INT jumper is out on the 12892B MP card, then a pending interrupt is
   always recognized, regardless of the "cpu_interrupt_enable" flag setting.

   See the "Set Phase Logic Flowchart" for the transition from phase 1A to phase
   1B, and "Section III Theory of Operation," "Control Section Detailed Theory"
   division, "Phase Control Logic" subsection, "Phase 1B" paragraph (3-241) in
   the Model 2100A Computer Installation and Maintenance Manual for details.

/* I/O subsystem local utility routine declarations */


/* Initialize the I/O system.

   This routine is called in the instruction prelude to set up the I/O access
   table prior to beginning execution.  The table is indexed by select code, and
   each entry records pointers to the device and DIB structures assoicated with
   that select code.  This allows fast access to the device trace flags and to
   the device interface routine by the I/O instruction executors, respectively.

   As part of the device scan, the sizes of the largest device name and active
   trace flag name among the devices enabled for tracing are accumulated for use
   in aligning the trace statements.

   The "is_executing" parameter indicates whether or not initialization is being
   performed from the instruction execution prelude.  If it is, the routine also
   sets the priority holdoff and interrupt request bit vectors by asserting the
   SIR signal to each enabled device interface routine.  Sending SIR to all
   devices will set the "interrupt_request" variable if an interrupt is pending,
   so no explicit poll is needed after initialization.

   After initializing the I/O access table, a check is made for device
   conflicts.  These occur if two or more devices are assigned to the same
   select code.

   Each select code must be unique among the enabled devices.  This requirement
   is checked as part of the instruction execution prelude; this allows the user
   to exchange two select codes simply by setting each device to the other's
   select code.  If conflicts were enforced instead at the time the codes were
   entered, the first device would have to be set to an unused select code
   before the second could be set to the first device's code.

   If any conflicts exist, the device table is scanned to find the DIBs whose
   select codes match the conflicting values, and the device names associated
   with the conflicts are printed.

   This routine returns the success or failure of I/O initialization; failure
   is reported if any select code conflicts exist.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If this routine is called from the instruction prelude, the console and
       optional log file have already been put into "raw" output mode.
       Therefore, newlines are not translated to the correct line ends on
       systems that require it.  Before reporting a conflict, "sim_ttcmd" is
       called to restore the console and log file translation.  This is OK
       because a conflict will abort the run and return to the command line
       anyway.

    2. sim_dname is called instead of using dptr->name directly to ensure that
       we pick up an assigned logical device name.

    3. Only the names of active trace (debug) options are accumulated to produce
       the most compact trace log.  However, if the CPU device's EXEC option is
       enabled, then all of the CPU option names are accumulated, as EXEC
       enables all trace options for a given instruction or instruction class.
