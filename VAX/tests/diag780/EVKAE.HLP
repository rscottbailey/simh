1 HELP
 This program tests the major portion of  the  VAX  architecture
 that  requires privileges above and beyond those available to a
 user program running in user mode under VMS.

1 SECTION

2 MEMMGT

 Tests various types of exceptions and interrupts.

2 REGISTERS
 Tests of the various Internal Processor Registers.

2 CHANGEMODE
 Tests  of  the  change  mode  instructions  and   the   special
 exceptions associated to them.

2 TIMERS
 Tests of the interval timer and the time-of-year clock.
