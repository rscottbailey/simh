1 HELP
 This program  exercises  all  of  the  VAX  compatibility  mode
 instruction set.

1 SECTION

2 EXCEPTIONS
 Tests the various compatibility mode  exceptions  by  verifying
 the  mechanisms  used  by the VAX architecture to change to and
 from PDP-11 compatibility mode.

2 INSTRUCTIONS
 Tests compatibility mode Single, Double,  and  Program  Control
 instructions.

1 EVENT
 Event Flag 1 (set) - Accelerator testing (standalone  only)  is
 inhibited.  Event Flag 1 (clear) - Accelerator testing provided
 :  if Accelerator is present, the entire EVKAD  test  sequences
 are  run  twice  for  each  test  pass,  once  with Accelerator
 disabled, and once with Accelerator enabled.

1 QUICK
 The QUICK flag has no effect on this program.

1 SUMMARY
 This program does not provide a summary report.
